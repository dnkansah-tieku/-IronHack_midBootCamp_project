The objective set out in this project is to predict the selling price of houses based on a variety of features such as;
-Date of construction
- Presence or absence of waterfront
- The rating based on the condiditon ranging from 1-13: with 13 as excellent
- Overall grade assigned to the house
- Square feet above: square footage of house apart from basement
- Square feet living after renovation: Living room area in 2015(implies - some renovations). This might or might not have affected the lotsize area.
- Square feet lot after renovation, among others

The project was tackled by initially exploring the data and understanding the behaviuor of the independent variables in relation to the dependent or the target variable (price)
and being able to make decisions on case basis.
